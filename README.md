# Readme

Well, my name is RÃ´mulo, I'm learning how to code on The Odin Project classes.
I'm starting from the very beginning, 
3 months back on february/2021 I didn't know how to do simple stuff,
Now I know basic CSS and HTML and I'm hoping to keep on learning
On this project I have to build a site similar to Google.com
